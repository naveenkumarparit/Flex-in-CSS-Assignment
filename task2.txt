Task2: Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model.
        1. justify-content
        2. align-items
        3. gap
        4. flex-direction
        5. flex-wrap
Sol: 
1. justify-content: 
        justify-content is used to align flex items along the main axis (horizontal by default) of the flex container.
        It controls the distribution of space between and around items in a flex container.
        Values include flex-start (default), flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, and space-evenly.

2. align-items:
        align-items is used to align flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.
        It defines how the items are positioned within the flex container vertically.
        Values include flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch (default).

3. gap:
        gap is a shorthand property for setting the gap between flex items in both directions.
        It's used in both CSS Flexbox layouts to specify the spacing between the flex items.
        It combines the properties row-gap and column-gap in Grid and the properties gap and row-gap in Flexbox.

4. flex-direction:
        flex-direction determines the primary axis of the flex container.
        It specifies if the flex items should be placed in a row (row), a row-reverse (row-reverse), a column (column), or a column-reverse (column-reverse) layout.
        This property essentially defines if the main axis is horizontal or vertical.

5. flex-wrap:
        flex-wrap determines how the flex items should wrap within the flex container if they cannot all fit in a single line.
        Values include nowrap (all items stay in a single line), wrap (items wrap onto new lines if needed), and wrap-reverse (items wrap in reverse order).
