Task1: Describe the main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?
Sol: 
CSS Flexbox: 
        Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or column.
        It's excellent for arranging items in a single direction (either vertically or horizontally).
        It provides a flexible way to distribute space and align items within a container.
        Ideal for creating navigation bars, flexible content containers, and centering elements within a container.

CSS Grid:
        Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing both rows and columns to be defined.
        It provides a grid-based layout system that excels at organizing content both horizontally and vertically.
        Grid is perfect for complex, grid-like structures where elements need to be placed in specific rows and columns.
        It allows for precise control over the placements of items, making it suitable for creating entire page layouts.

When to use Which:
        You might choose Flexbox when you need to arrange items in a single direction, for example, we use flexbox in creating navigation bars, header/footer parts of a webpage or aligning elements within a container. It is useful in centering items in a container very easily.

        You might choose Grid when you need to create more complex, two-dimensional layouts in a webpage with rows and columns. It's particularly used when you have grid-like structures, such as image-galleries, flipkart/amazon products page, forms with multiple fields, or any design that require precise control over both rows and columns.
